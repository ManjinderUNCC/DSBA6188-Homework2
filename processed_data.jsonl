{"text": "Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.", "label": "RELEVANT"}

Those can last you over a couple days, and you can put a variety of ingredients in there depending on what you have! Bacon, ham, cold cuts, veggies, potatoes, make your own flavor combos: https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/frittata-recipes/ When you want to start cooking with wine, I highly recommend using red wine for your meats, and white wine for chicken or fish. You can also tackle that vanilla extract any time you want, it can be pretty cheap and adds loads of flavor. One small bottle of that stuff will last you a long time. You can make yourself pancakes, or even muffins and scones to last you over the course of the week. You could even do something like a quick bread, like banana bread, blueberry bread, chocolate chip bread: http://www.midwestliving.com/food/breakfast/sweet-bread-treats/?page=5, they'd be great with some coffee or tea for breakfast. When it comes to cheap ingredients, I recommend Struggle Meals by Tastemade on Youtube! You cold also make chili or cold pasta salads which can be cheap and very versatile depending on what's available or on sale at your local store. Chili: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/best-chili-recipes-gallery Cold pasta salads: https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2365/pasta-salad-recipes/ You could also make tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, fajitas, and quesadillas if you're into that type of cuisine! They're all very versatile: https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/quesadilla-recipes-quick-dinner/ Asian inspired meals could be fun too, like teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, all of these can be served with a side of jasmine rice.

Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato purée to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Purée and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo. Toast and de seed them, make a bed of sliced white onions in a large skillet, add your peppers to the top of it, fill with about a half inch of beef stock, oregano and salt, cover and simmer for 30 mins. Purée and strain.

Once cooked, as far as I understand it, it looses its positive properties and can actually be harmful - I've heard people claim this but I am having trouble finding any source. Perhaps a biologist or chemist can opine. Nevertheless, take any pan over high heat and let it get hot, but not so hot that it will scald olive oil in seconds. Also, preheat oven to 350, say. Season raw chicken directly. put in a tablespoon or so of OO and once shimmering, place chix in pan. Don't touch. Let brown. The chicken will release itself, even from a non-stick pan. Once it's cooked about 1/2 way through, just take the pan (assuming it's oven safe) and put the whole thing in the oven for 5-10 minutes. Don't undercook, but please... please... don't overcook the damn thing. Remove from oven and take out of pan. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve.

You'll need four duck legs (with thighs). Salt them (30g coarse salt sound vaguely familiar to me but I usually eyeball it) and season with thyme, juniper berries and black pepper and leave in the fridge overnight. In the morning clean the salt off (some people wash the meat, I never do because Raymond Blanc says not to). Put in a casserole dish or similar and cover with duck or goose fat and cook in the oven on a very low heat for about 4 hours. Shred the meat and let it cool before adding 1-2tbsp of chestnut puree, 2 tbsp chopped chives and enough heavy cream to bimd it all together. Taste and adjust according to your preference. If it's too salty add more cream. This also freezes really well and can be used to made duck bon bons by rolling the mix into balls, refrigerating to firm them up, then breadcrumbing and deep frying.", "label": "RELEVANT"}

{"text": "My gf and I prepare a casserole or large dish every Sunday night, which serves as dinner and makes 3-4 lunches for both of us throughout the week. We also freeze some and rotate them, so we might eat the same one 2-3 times and take one from a previous week. We generally rotate around: * Lentil dahl or variation of some lentil dish. * Lasagna or some other pasta dish. Sometimes with meat, sometimes without. Rigatoni with italian sausage is one of my favs. * Mexican casserole with beans, corn, cheese., or some combo of tex-mex inspired food that does large portions like tons of fajitas (which freeze great), or a big enchilada casserole. * Big batch of stew or curry with lots of vegetables. Basically anything that doesn't take too long to make a big batch of, is healthy and is lunchable. Of course we'll make food with leftovers sometimes during the week, but I find it better to eat a salad or sandwich (which aren't great to keep overnight) at night and take my big meal at lunch. Furthermore, IMO, it's not really efficient to spend time cooking the night before if you're not planning on making a meal out of it. If you're gonna be in the kitchen, might as well eat, right? :) Extend that, and the best way to spend your kitchen time is to prep a lot of food in advance. If you really need a quick meal to prepare as a last minute thing to make a lunch, like the other commenters said, sandwiches are the quickest. But the feeling of popping out a beautiful, warm dish at lunch that keeps you filled for the next 4-5+ hours is more pleasant.", "label": "RELEVANT"}

{"text": "You mentioned pulled pork, so this jumped to mind. for an amazing NC-style pulled pork BBQ from hog to plate, make sure to mop the pork with the vinegar BBQ sauce. Even if you can't do a whole hog and are instead smoking (preferred) or roasting a pork butt or shoulder, open the door every so often, remove any outer shell of cooked meat and baste with some sauce. As for the sauce, every NC BBQ master has their own recipe, but if you really want that sauce to pop, add some red pepper flakes and bring the concoction to a boil. That helps the flavors to blend. Alternately, you can just let the sauce sit overnight to blend a little. I'm from NC and now live in VA. We tried a new BBQ place in MD, so of course, I tried some of their pulled pork and sauce. the pork was pretty good (hickory smoked), but I almost wept at the sauce: apple cider vinegar, a little sugar, some salt, and pre-ground black pepper. It was so bland and just tasted like pepper. edit: One more trick for pecan pie. I use 2.5 cups of pecan halves per pie, which mounds up nicely with the custard base. I also use a basting brush to spread chocolate liqueur on the crust. A former co-worker shunned my pie at a company potluck, saying he hated pecan pies. After the potluck, he comes to my office carrying an empty pie plate. He had eaten over half of it, even the crust, which he usually just leaves on the plate.", "label": "RELEVANT"}
